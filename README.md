## Description

Welcome to our Data Analysis and Segmentation Project with Pokémon!

**Front-end**: Explore Pokémon data interactively, with styling in development and filter buttons being implemented.

**Back-end**: Integrated with the PokeAPI API through Flask, providing quick access to information. We're adding advanced filters.

**Data Layer**: Using algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, and Random Forest, we segment and analyze Pokémon data.

This project is open for the community to contribute and learn as we explore data and Pokémon together!
